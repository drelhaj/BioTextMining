The biomedical association study word family list supplied here is an adapted version of Laurence Anthonyâ€™s Someya Lemma List (no hyphens), originally created by Yasumasa Someya. Use of the word family list should also cite the Someya Lemma List (no hyphens) on which it is based. This can be found at: www.laurenceanthony.net/software/antconc/
